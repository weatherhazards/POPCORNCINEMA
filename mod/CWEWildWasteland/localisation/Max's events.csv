EVTDESC8015880;After the conclusion of Ross Perot's term, factional conflict has boiled over in the Reform Party, and there is now an all-out war between competing factions of the Party. Unfortunately, this has been exacerbated by the party's broken mail-in primary system, allowing any American to participate in the primaries. As a result, Pat Buchanan has flooded the party with his supporters. Buchanan is a reactionary American nationalist who wants to secure glory for an explicitly white and christian America. In opposition stands Governor Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, and his hand-picked candidate for the Reform Party nomination, Donald Trump. Trump is a billionaire, who recently wrote a book outlining his Presidential plans. He plans to continue in the same vein as Perot, seeking to reduce the deficit, create a universal healthcare system, increase taxes, and reduce foreign commitments. The battle between these two factions, and these two men, is a battle for the soul of the party. Which faction will secure control?;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
