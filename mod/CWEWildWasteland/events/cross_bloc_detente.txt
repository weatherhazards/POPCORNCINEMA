Though we know the communist system is the one of the future, and these states are tools to control the masses and doomed to fail, they may have things we need. Such as guns. Or food. Anyway, it seems $FROMCOUNTRY$ has resolved this question for all - the capitalist order will fall of its own accord, and the immediate goal is to coexist. While this is technically revisionism, perhaps it is true that Marx could not have foreseen the atom bomb. Still, though this is not the first such instance, questioning the foundation of our ideology may be unwise.
